Examples to run the tool on.

Folder structure might be weird because I just copied my current album project folder.

# Instructions

```sh
ffg-gen.py dialogue all
```

```sh
ffg-gen.py bio all
```

```sh
ffg-gen.py ending all
```

The files here have the default names so you don't have to provide them as args.

The tool should generate a completed mlt with all the components. 
You still need to open the mlt in shotcut and copy-paste all the non-bottom tracks into a new mlt file. 
The mlt files generated by this tool will have bottom tracks that bug out if you ever try to modify them in Shotcut. 
I can't figure out how to fix that, so this is the compromise.
