Examples to run the tool on.

Folder structure might be weird because I just copied my current album project folder.

# Instructions

```bash
ffg-gen.py dialogue all
```

The files here have the default names so you don't have to provide them as args.

The tool should generate a separate mlt for each component. Then you open each mlt in shotcut and copy-paste the clips into a master project. 
I can't figure out how to generate a multi-track project with the library, so this is the compromise.
