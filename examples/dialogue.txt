@enter sameika

Sameika3: Eh? Someone's playing some kind of koto.

@enter reimu

Sameika1: checking that reimu's expression is 3
Sameika: empty expression will just continue current expression

@set reimu displayName "Bob"
@set reimu headerOutlineColor "#aaaa9300"

Reimu1: Why is my name bob now

@reset reimu

灵梦2: okay i'm back

@set reimu displayName 'Bob'
@set reimu headerOutlineColor '#aaaa9300'

灵梦1: oh no i'm bob again

@nick kiko ???

???: I don't need an expression if I'm not on screen yet

Sameika1: Still, it's a lead, so let's follow it.

???2: but i do need something to set my expression before i appear

(Kiko comes on screen, guitar part stops)
@enter kiko
@wait 2.0

@unset reimu displayName

???1: Ah! It looks like I attracted some visitors.

Reimu7: at least i'm no longer bob now

@alias reimu sameika

@unset reimu headerOutlineColor

Reimu1: Oh I'm red again

@exit reimu
@alias kiko 木子

@set kiko frontBrightness 0.4

木子1: I have a name you know

@unnick kiko

木子1: oops

@unset kiko frontBrightness

Sameika3: (For some reason, I don't believe it. Where would she even keep it..?)
Kiko8: Really..? That's so bothersome.

@enter reimu

@unalias sameika

木子8: I was just getting to enjoy the cool air and the shade..
Sameika5: It's too gloomy and pathetic here for silence to be relaxing.
Reimu6: Well, we're not stopping.
Reimu7: (..Doesn't her tree need sunlight anyway?)

(Boss theme starts)

Kiko1: I guess I'll have to fight you, so here I go.

Kiko9lo: Ahhh, I lost..
Kiko1lo: The sun is enjoyable, so maybe it isn't so bad for the incident to end.
Sameika8: That was really pointless, wasn't it?
Reimu4: There's always someone who has to get in my way for no reason.
Reimu4: I wish these youkai would finally remember who I am,
Reimu4: so I don't have to keep reminding them with a beatdown.
Sameika1: At least we know there's nothing here.
Sameika2: The youkai are probably causing the humans lots of grievance,
Kiko1lo: say something
Sameika2: so onward we go.
