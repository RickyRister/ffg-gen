@wait 1

Sameika3: Eh? Someone's playing some kind of koto.
Reimu3: I'm only more cautious from that.
Reimu1: It takes a lot of idiocy to make so much noise in a forest,
Reimu1: unless you have something to show or a reason to attract danger.
Sameika1: Still, it's a lead, so let's follow it.
Sameika1: I'm sure nothing here is that threatening to you..

(Kiko comes on screen, guitar part stops)
@wait 2

Sameika2: does wait work?

Kiko1: Ah! It looks like I attracted some visitors.
Reimu7: (So it was idiocy.. a kodama of all things.)
Reimu1: Was that music coming from you? I don't see any instruments around here.
Kiko1: Yep. I just put it away.
Sameika3: (For some reason, I don't believe it. Where would she even keep it..?)
Kiko3: I don't recognise you, though. Are you lost?
Reimu1: No, we're looking for whoever's causing this darkness.
Kiko8: Really..? That's so bothersome.
Kiko8: I was just getting to enjoy the cool air and the shade..
Kiko8: The forest is much less noisy too, since all of the youkai are off somewhere else.
Kiko8: I don't really want you to ruin that..
Sameika5: It's too gloomy and pathetic here for silence to be relaxing.
Reimu6: Well, we're not stopping.
Reimu7: (..Doesn't her tree need sunlight anyway?)

(Boss theme starts)

Kiko1: I guess I'll have to fight you, so here I go.
