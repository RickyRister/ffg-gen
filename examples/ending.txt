The Nameless Hill.
Once a place for young children to be abandoned and whisked away by youkai.
Now, it has been transformed into an enormous festival ground out of seemingly\
nowhere.
---
As the culprit sinks to the ground, it's impossible to tell whether the darkness\
has retreated or not. 
From inside the festival grounds, it always seems to be daytime.

Rumia: She wasn't lying, surprising for a backstabbing god. 
I don't sense myself getting any weaker, or any of the shadows outside reeling back.
Marisa: Seriously?!
Ahh, why do I have to deal with this— 
an incident where just beating up the source can't solve it..
---
Reimu: Marisa? You already beat me to it.. 
well, whatever. I got caught up with that lantern youkai anyway.
Sameika: (Ahh, they already knocked her down? What a shame.
At least that deals with my worries.)
---
Reimu: Who's that next to you, though? Is that an outsider?
Rumia: You really don't recognise me?! Rude, isn't it!
Reimu: It's not my fault that you're just one of a hundred youkai.. 
I have too many faces to remember.
---
Marisa: Well, that's Rumia. I can explain later, right now there's a bigger\
problem.
Reimu: Aah?

(Hikaru had already gotten back to her feet, dusting herself off.)

Hikaru: To answer your question, ink-black witch, I was never the one carrying\
out the incident in full.
Reimu: Seriously.. then who? I don't have time to guess.
Hikaru: I'm certain you can figure it out, lest you reveal how much your\
intelligence is worth, haha.
---
Rumia: How cocky.. so, this was never the work of you alone, then.
But.. how? I've never encountered any other youkai with power over darkness.
There shouldn't be anyone else who can do this.
---
Hikaru: Is it the youkai of nothingness who fears the unknown now? Hahah.
Well, if you wish to brighten this dim night, then bring one of these lanterns!
They shall push back the cruel shadows for as long as they burn.
---
Reimu: (They're kind of cheaply made, looking closely..)
---
Marisa: Thanks, but.. I gotta ask why you are bothering to help us.
Didn't you orchestrate this whole plan?
---
Hikaru: Like I said, I have already succeeded. 
This was just a plan to gather faith, after all.
It's about time for it to wrap up.
---
Marisa: Ah.. You gods will do anything for that, even stooping to the lows of\
youkai.
Whatever, though. Where's the actual mess maker hiding out?
Hikaru: ...
Marisa: What? Spit it out.
---
Hikaru: Ahahah, about such.. 
You see, I cannot truly know such a thing, as the world is coated in their shade..
I'm certain you and your friend can rat them out.. Yes, certainly.
//(Marisa is pulling on her hat here.)
---
Marisa: I thought this couldn't get any worse… now I have to run around the whole\
of Gensokyo?
Now I'm seeing why it's better for Reimu to be the one solving all these\
incidents..!
---
Reimu: Oi. Don't push it onto me just so you can live easily.
Rumia: Groveling about it is killing our time. Get going.
(I'm starting to get hungry as well… I hope this is over soon.)
---
Marisa: Ahh, fine.. Let's go!

Even with the god of light defeated, the incident refused to stop. 
The darkness in Gensokyo continued to encroach the whole world,\
human and youkai alike.
---
Reimu and Sameika had set off towards another objective,
having heard something important from the strangely relaxed god.
