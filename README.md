# Touhou Fake Fangame Album Video Generator

Tool for autogenerating components for a Touhou Fake Fangame Album Video for Shotcut.

Yes, an extremely specific niche, I know.

Each component will be generated as an mlt file. 
You can then open that file in shotcut and copy-paste the component into your actual project.

## Dependencies
This tool uses [vidpy](https://github.com/antiboredom/vidpy) to deal with the hard stuff.

Vidpy, in turn, requires melt to be installed. Easiest way to do that is to install [Shotcut](https://www.shotcut.org). 
Then again, why are you using this tool if you don't have Shotcut installed?

## Usage
Just run `ffg-gen.py -h`. 
I could write more info here later, but right now too much stuff is changing for me to do that.
